      <description>Motivation&amp;#182; I was looking to run association analysis in Python using the apriori algorithm to derive rules of the form {A} -&amp;gt; {B}. However, I quickly discovered that it&#39;s not part of the standard Python machine learning libraries. Although there are some implementations that exist, I could not find one capable of handling large datasets. &#34;Large&#34; in my case was an orders dataset with 32 million records, containing 3.2 million unique orders and about 50K unique items (file size just over 1 GB).</description>
